# Employee Directory

I have generated an App using (React) that will allow users to be able to view thier entire employee directory at once so they have quick access to thier information.

# How to use

When users loads the page, a table of employees should render.
Users can search by first name, last name, email adress, phone number or age. 
Users can also sort the table with all categories listed.
